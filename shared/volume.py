"""System volume, read from the default PipeWire sink.

Two callers need it: the monitor loop in emax_controller, which pushes the
level to the keyboard's wheel display over `11 83`, and the Everest panel,
which mirrors what the keyboard is being sent.

The default sink is re-resolved on every read, so switching output device is
followed with no extra work. `wpctl` is used where WirePlumber runs and `pactl`
otherwise, because a PulseAudio system without WirePlumber has no `wpctl` at
all and would otherwise report nothing at all.

Both are run with the bundle's library-path injection stripped, the house rule
for anything we launch (#49), and with `LC_ALL=C`: `pactl` translates its
output, so on a German desktop `pactl subscribe` says `Ereignis` where the
filter looks for `Event` and every change would be missed.

Why a watcher and not a poll: the loop pushes the level several times a second.
Any staleness in the cached value is pushed *over* the level the firmware just
set from a wheel turn, so the display visibly snaps back to the old number
until the next poll. `pactl subscribe` makes the update immediate instead of
merely frequent. If it is unavailable the code falls back to a rate-limited
poll, which still works — it just flickers on wheel turns.
